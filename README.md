### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary:

Complete rewrite of an old project, trying to make a complete package that can handel text as well as files.

Files will be treated as gziped then converted to HEX and then encrypted using an adaptation with some minor tweaks to the original Playfair working.

I hope a later integration in AlmaPix which is a multi-encryption protocol app made for cascading encryption and/or stenography.
