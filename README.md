### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary:

Complete rewrite of an old project, trying to make a complete package that can handel text as well as files.

Files will be treated as gziped then converted to HEX and then encrypted using an adaptation with some minor tweaks to the original Playfair working.

I hope a later integration in AlmaPix which is a multi-encryption protocol app made for cascading encryption and/or stenography.

* Current Version:
almost ready for first release, everything works, so you can clone repo. I want to add an interactive console interface before releasing.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
For now you need to clone the repo or download it's zip then compile it on your computer in order to get a runnable binary.
* How to run tests
If you set this repo up in a developing environment you will find sample code in src/net/codeartha/playfair/Sample.java

Which show examples of how to use the Playfair package.
